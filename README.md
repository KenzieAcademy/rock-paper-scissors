# Rock, Paper, Scissors
This is a simple, purposely incomplete implementation of rock, paper, scissors.
Your goal is to complete the implementation such that the correct winner is
reported. At the moment, the player always loses!

# Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/aspidites/rock-paper-scissors.git
```
2. Choose a challenge level and check out the corresponding branch. For example:
```
git checkout epic
```

3. Get hacking! Note, that you should only be modifying `game.js`. The only
   reason you should touch `index.html` is if you decide that you want to make
   things more pretty!

4. Profit.

# Challenge Levels
This Repository has three different challenge levels, marked as branches. If you
are unsure where to start and are new to programming, we suggest Explorer mode.
If you want a challenge, but don't know how big of a challenge you can handle,
we suggest checking out Epic mode and downgrading if it's too intimidating.

## Explorer
You are giving a precise list of changes that should be made in order to get the
implementation finished, as well as some basic scaffolding to get you on your
way.

## Adventure
You are given hints as to what different javascript features do, but are not
otherwise told how to complete the implementation.

## Epic
You are given no hints about how to implement the missing functionality beyond
what the expected results are.
